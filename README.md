# Movie_Analysis
This project presents a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a movie dataset to uncover insights about box office revenues, budgets, genres, ratings, and other key features that influence a movie's success. The analysis leverages Python's data science libraries to perform cleaning, visualization, and basic statistical evaluations.
