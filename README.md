# Movie_Analysis
This project presents a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a movie dataset to uncover insights about box office revenues, budgets, genres, ratings, and other key features that influence a movie's success. The analysis leverages Python's data science libraries to perform cleaning, visualization, and basic statistical evaluations.


Project Structure

    Movie Portfolio Project.ipynb â€” The main Jupyter Notebook containing code, analysis, and visualizations.

    movies.csv â€” Dataset file containing movie-related information (downloaded from Kaggle).

ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview

    Source: Kaggle - Movies Dataset by Daniel Grijalva
    https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies

    Description:
    The dataset provides metadata for over 7,000 movies, including:

        Title

        Genre

        Director

        Release Year

        Budget

        Revenue

        IMDB Rating

        Runtime

        Popularity score

    Note: Make sure to download and place movies.csv in the project directory to run the notebook smoothly.

ðŸš€ Technologies Used

    Programming Language: Python 3

    Libraries:

        pandas â€” For data manipulation and analysis

        numpy â€” For numerical computations

        matplotlib â€” For basic plotting

        seaborn â€” For advanced statistical visualizations

ðŸ“ˆ Key Analyses Performed

    General overview and cleaning of the movie dataset

    Analysis of budget versus revenue trends

    Investigation of how genre affects profitability

    Identification of top-performing directors

    Correlation between IMDB rating and movie success

    Visualization of movie production trends over the years

    ðŸ“¢ Important Notes

    This project is focused purely on exploratory data analysis (EDA).

    No machine learning models are trained or deployed in this notebook (optional for future work).

âœ¨ Future Enhancements

    Perform predictive modeling to forecast movie revenues.

    Expand analysis to include actors, award wins/nominations, or international box office results.

    Build a dynamic dashboard using Plotly Dash or Streamlit for better interactivity.
